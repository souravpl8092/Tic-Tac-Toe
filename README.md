# TIC-TAC-TOE

Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a simple game for two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the goal is to be the first player to get three of their symbols (usually X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Each player takes turns marking a square on the grid with their symbol. Once a square is marked, it cannot be changed. The game ends when all of the squares are filled or one player has three of their symbols in a row. If all of the squares are filled and neither player has won, the game is a tie.

Tic-tac-toe is a great game to play when you're bored, and it's often used to help children learn basic problem-solving and strategy skills.

As tic-tac-toe is a solved game, meaning that one player always wins or ties.
